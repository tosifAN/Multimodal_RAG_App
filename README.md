# Multimodal RAG Application for Medical Use Cases

Welcome to the **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) App** repository! This project explores the fascinating intersection of **Generative AI** and **Healthcare**, offering a comprehensive guide to building a multimodal RAG app tailored specifically for medical applications.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find the code and resources for creating a cutting-edge multimodal RAG application, combining various advanced technologies to enhance medical information retrieval and response generation. The app leverages:

- **GPT-4V**: A powerful language model renowned for its versatility and depth in handling complex tasks.
- **Embedding Model and Vector Database**: These components enrich the app's understanding and response accuracy by retrieving relevant medical data.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework used to build an efficient and robust backend API for the application.
- **Unstructured Library**: An essential tool for processing medical documents (PDFs, tables, images), providing crucial support in the medical field where data is often encapsulated in complex formats.

## Features

1. **Multimodal Input**: The app accepts various input types, such as text queries and medical images, to generate accurate and relevant answers.
2. **Document Processing**: Capable of handling unstructured medical documents (PDFs), extracting important information from tables and images.
3. **Interactive User Interface**: Users can pose queries, and the app responds with precise, multimodal answers, often accompanied by relevant images or documents.
4. **Fast and Scalable Backend**: Powered by FastAPI for speed and scalability, making it ideal for real-world healthcare environments.

## Technologies Used

- **GPT-4V**: For natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Embedding Models**: Used for improved knowledge retrieval from the vector database.
- **FastAPI**: A Python framework for creating fast, efficient APIs.
- **Vector Databases**: To store and retrieve relevant documents and embeddings.
- **Unstructured Library**: To process complex medical documents, such as PDFs containing tables and images.

## Application Flow

1. **User Query**: The user inputs a query via the web interface, such as a medical question or symptom description.
2. **Multimodal Processing**: The query and any associated images or documents are processed through the multimodal RAG pipeline.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: The app retrieves relevant medical documents from the vector database and integrates the information into the generated response.
4. **Response**: The app provides a comprehensive, multimodal response, often accompanied by relevant medical images or document extracts.

## How to Use
